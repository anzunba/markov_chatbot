Snake    : That was quite a cocktail. Anything else in there?

Naomi    : Those nanomachines will also keep your Codec's batteries charged up.

Snake    : I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet.

Naomi    : You're welcome.

Snake    : I need to borrow your scissors.

Naomi    : What are you going to do?

Snake    : Don't worry. Just going to clean myself up a little.

Naomi    : Huh?

Snake    : I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists.

******************************************************************************


(Snake swims through the lower dock of the disposal facility.  We see
a man riding up the cargo elevator.)


Liquid   : Stay alert!  He'll be through here, I know it.  I'm going to go
           swat down a couple of bothersome flies.

(Snake removes his flippers and calls Campbell on the codec.)


Snake    : This is Snake.  Colonel, can you hear me?

Campbell : Loud and clear Snake.  What's the situation?

Snake    : Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up.

Campbell : Just as I expected.  You'll have to take the elevator to the
           surface.  But make sure that nobody sees you.  If you need to
           contact me by codec, the frequency is 140.85.  When you want to use
           the codec push the Select button. When we need to contact you the
           codec will beep.  When you hear that noise push the Select button.
           The codec directly stimulates the small bones of your ear, no one
           but you will be able to hear it.

Snake    : Got it, okay, I'm ready to go.
