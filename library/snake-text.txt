 I should've known you were behind this, Colonel . 
 What do you want from me ? 
 Invited ! ? That's what you call sending armed soldiers after me ? 
 I'm retired from FOX-HOUND . You're not my commander anymore, and I don't have to take orders from you or anyone else . 
 Who's this ? 
 Are you military ? 
 What's the shot for ? 
 What soldiers ? 
 A nuclear weapon ? 
 FOX-HOUND hijacking a nuclear weapon ? 
 Those are some heavy duty hostages . 
 Questions ? I haven't even said whether I'd accept this mission . 
 Tell me about the nuclear weapons disposal facility . 
 So someone needs to penetrate, gather intelligence, and report back . . . Sounds like a spy movie . What's the insertion method ? 
 Not with this storm going on . 
 Approach ? 
 And then ? 
 Launch ? 
 You want me to swim in sub-zero Alaskan water ? 
 Anyone going with me ? 
 Weapons and equipment OSP (on-site procurement) ? 
 The Chief of DARPA and the president of an arms manufacturing company . . . what business did they have at a nuclear weapons disposal facility ? 
 Must be extremely important exercises if those two were directly involved . Were they testing some kind of new advanced weapon ? 
 Do we know exactly where they're being held ? 
 Do they really have the ability to launch a nuclear missile ? 
 Was the number confirmed ? 
 Isn't there some kind of safety device to prevent this kind of terrorism ? 
 PAL ? 
 Why not ? 
 But even if they have a nuclear warhead, it must've been removed from its missile . All the missiles on these disposal sites are supposed to be dismantled . It's not that easy to get your hands on an ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missle) . 
 So what exactly are they demanding ? 
 Remains ? 
 Cell specimens ? Why would they want that ? 
 Strengthened ? 
 There are genes that do that ? 
 Gene therapy ? 
 Okay, and so if you knew what genes were responsible for making the perfect soldier, you could implant them in the same way, right ? 
 One of the greatest soldiers ever ? 
 You don't mean Big Boss ? ! 
 So his body was recovered after all . 
 Priceless to the military perhaps . 
 You people are amazing . And then you're going to transplant those genes into soldiers ? 
 The Sons of Big Boss . 
 What's the time limit ? 
 Did they say what the target will be ? 
 When did the countdown start ? 
 Colonel, who are you speaking for ? 
 So who's in supervisory control of this operation ? 
 Which means that the President must be meeting with his top aides in the map room about now, huh ? 
 If that's a real nuclear warhead, shouldn't they issue a COG (Continuity of Government) ? 
 Well if they haven't relocated to nuclear shelter under Mount Washingtion, I suppose there isn't that much reason to worry yet . Is the National Security Agency in on this ? 
 The DIA ? I'm starting to get a bad feeling about this . 
 We don't need desk jockies . We need a nuclear weapons specialist . 
 We need backup from a specialist . I'm just an amateur when it comes to nuclear weapons . 
 A female analyst ? 
 Where's she working from ? 
 California . Seems like a million miles away . 
 How well-armed are these terrorists ? I know there was an exercise going on at the time they revolted . 
 What about they're battle experience . 
 I wouldn't expect anything less from FOX-HOUND . 
 Tell me about these Next-Generation Special Forces . 
 Looks like a pretty international group . Mercenaries ? 
 Outer Heaven . 
 Video game players, huh ? 
 I thought using genetically modified soldiers was prohibited by international law . 
 How could an entire unit be subverted to rebellion ? 
 The Sons of Big Boss . But if they were regular army, they must've been interviewed periodically by army counsellers . 
 But they all took part in the uprising ? 
 Was there any sign recently that something might be wrong ? 
 They can do that even without you ? 
 So they're still around . 
 Looks like a lovely bunch of folks . Too bad we'll be meeting under these circumstances . 
 Liquid Snake ? ! 
 Liquid Snake . 
 Tell me what you know . 
 I was just a kid myself back then . 
 He was a spy for the British Secret Intelligence Service ? 
 I thought that by the time I left they were no longer using codenames . 
 I have a twin ? 
 Why don't I find that thought more comforting ? 
 Colonel, I don't work for the government anymore . Let me go back to Twin Lakes . 
 There's a dogsled race this week . Next Saturday I have to be in Anchorage . 
 Right now my fifty huskies are my only family . I've got to take care of them . 
 What do you mean ? 
 I told you, even if I do owe you I don't anything to this army or this country ! 
 Why should I be stupid enough to do that ? I'm no patriot . 
 Oh I see . Blackmail . 
 Why do you say that ? 
 You think my life is some kind of joke ? 
 Colonel, you're retired . Why are you involved in this ? 
 Is that really the only reason ? 
 Colonel, you're a lousy liar . Tell me the real reason . 
 Who is it ? 
 What was your niece doing here ? 
 She looks like you . 
 A personal motive, Colonel . That's not very soldierly . 
 Since when are we friends ? 
 With my personality I don't have too many friends . 
 All right, but I have two conditions . 
 One, no more secrets between us . I want complete disclosure at all times and two, I'll only accept orders from you, Colonel . No cutoffs involved okay ? 
 What ? 
 I understand, Colonel . 
 That doctor . Is she part of this operation too ? 
 You mean you've seen them naked ? 
 By the way, what was that injection for ? 
 Nanomachines ? 
 Now I don't have to worry about food . 
 Say what ? 
 It'll make smarter huh ? Anything else ? 
 That was quite a cocktail . Anything else in there ? 
 I guess I can call you when I'm ready to go on a diet . 
 I need to borrow your scissors . 
 Don't worry . Just going to clean myself up a little . 
 I don't want to be mistaken for the leader of the terrorists . 
 This is Snake .  Colonel, can you hear me ? 
 Looks like the elevator in the back is the only way up . 
 Got it, okay, I'm ready to go . 
 It's Snake .  I'm in front of the disposal facility . 
 I'm nice and dry, but it is a little hard to move . 
 Take it easy, I'm grateful .  If it wasn't for your suit and your shot I would have turned into a popsicle out there . 
 I'm relieved to hear that .  Already tested, huh ?  By the way, how's the diversionary operation going ? 
 A Hind D ?  Colonel, what's a Russian gunship doing here ? 
 Who's that ? 
  . . . . . . 
 Nothing . . .I just didn't expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so . . .cute . 
 No, I'm serious .  Now I know I won't be bored for the next 18 hours . 
 Looks like we both have a lot to learn about each other . 
 Got it .  I'll call if I'm feeling lonely . 
 I remember .  First I'm strip searched by Doctor Naomi here, and then all my weapons are taken away .  Imagine yourself put in that position . 
 I'll hold you to that doctor .  By the way, sorry to dissapoint you but I did manage to smuggle out my smokes . 
 In my stomach .  Thanks to the shot you gave me that suppressed my stomach acids . 
 You never know . 
 I can't see it from here . 
 Master ?  What are you doing here ? 
 Passing on the skills to a new generation, huh ? 
 There's no one I'd rather have in a foxhole than you . 
 1st floor basement ventilation shaft . . . 
 Woman in the cell ? 
 There's an intruder besides me ? 
 I'm here to save you .  You're the DARPA Chief, Donald Anderson, right ? 
 I'm the pawn they sent here to save your worthless butt . 
 Slow down .  Don't worry .  First I want some information . . . about the terrorists . 
 Do they really have the ability to launch a nuke ? 
 The terrorists are threatening the White House .  They say if they don't accede to their demands they'll launch a nuclear weapon . 
 Is it possible ? ! 
 How do they plan to launch ?  I though this place was just for keeping the dismantled warheads .  THey shouldn't have access to a missile . . . 
 What ? 
 Metal Gear ! ?  It can't be ! 
 We've had a couple of run-ins in the past .  So that's the reason you were here at this disposal site ? 
 I had heard the Metal Gear project was scrapped . 
 Revolution . . .  ? 
 Rex ? 
 But I thought that all nuclear watheads were equipped with safety measures .  Some kind of detonation code that you have to input . 
 There are two passwords ? 
 Baker ?  The president of ArmsTech ? 
 You talked ? 
 Psycho Mantis ? 
  . . .This is bad . . . 
 If they find out Baker's password . . . 
 What ? 
 And if I do that ? 
 So where are the keys ? 
 Okay three card keys .  Do you know where they mught be keeping Baker ? 
 2nd floor basement ? 
 Any other clues ? 
 Personal Area Network, huh ? 
 And the doors will open automatically, gotcha .  OK .  I'm going to get you out of here . 
 What is it ? 
 No . 
 I just said no . 
 That's their problem .  It has nothing to do with my orders . 
 Pentagon ? 
 What is it ! ? 
 Hmmmm . . . dead . 
 Naomi !  The chief ! What happened ? 
  . . .Colonel, are you hiding something from me ? 
 You want me to believe that you are in charge of this op, but you don't have access to the complete file ! ? 
  . . . . . . . . 
 Is this the first time you've ever pointed a gun at a person ?  Your hands are shaking . 
 Can you shoot me, rookie ? 
 Liar !  That nervous glance . . . that scared look in your eyes . They're rookie's eyes if I ever saw them .  You've never shot a person, am I right ? 
 You haven't even taken the safety off, rookie . 
 You're not one of them are you ? 
 Why ? 
 Looks like we'll be a little delayed .  What are you doing ! ?  Don't think !  Shoot ! 
 Wait ! Who are you ? 
 Uuufff ! !  Damn ! ! 
 Naomi, I just had some kind of hallucination .  Is it from the nanomachines ? 
 So what was it ? 
 So that was Mantis . . . ? 
 Am I too late ? 
 He's alive .  You're the ArmsTech president Kenneth Baker, right ? Don't worry, I'm here to save you . 
 C4 ! 
 And you ? 
 Who are you ! ? 
 Who the hell ! ? 
 Can you talk ? 
 I'm not one of them .  The DARPA Chief told me he gave them his detonation code .  What about yours ? 
 Answer my question !  What about your code ! ?  There's no time ! 
 What ! Now the terrorists have both codes and can launch anytime ! 
 He couldn't read you ?  How'd you do it ? 
 Surgical implants ? 
 Even the DARPA Chief ? 
 But the DARPA Chief said Mantis got his code by reading his mind . 
 Yeah, I'm sure .  In that case, how did they get your code ? 
 It looks like he had some fun with you all right . 
 What happened to your arm ? 
 Looks like you're more than even now .  His was sliced off . 
 Dead . 
 Calm down !  What's wrong with you ?  I just told you I was here to save you !  I didn't kill the DARPA Chief .  He had a heart attack or something . 
 Anyway, the terrorists have both codes now . 
 I agree .  But what do they really want ? 
 Well I'm not going to let these maniacs start a war toady .  Do you still have the card keys . 
 To override tge detonation codes !  I heard you had them . . . 
 What ! ?  Who does then ! ?  Not the terrorists ! ? 
 Woman ! ?  Who ! ? 
 A female soldier ?  It must be . . . 
 A new recruit ?  Could that be the Colonel's niece ! ? 
 I'm sure she is .  She's green . . . but as tough as they come .  But how did you know she escaped ? 
 Codec ? 
 I'm sure she still has it .  What frequency was she at ? 
 Huh ? 
 Damn ! 
 I'll contact her right away .  But tell me . . . If this doesn't work, is there some other way to prevent the missile launch ? 
 Who's that ? 
 What if he can't come up with anything ? 
 Where is this Emmerich ? 
 I understand, but . . . why Metal Gear ?  The Nuclear Age ended with the turn of the millenium . 
  . . .No . 
 So they just close the lid and pretend like it'll go away ? 
 Unbelievable . 
 MUF ? 
 What about the other superpowers ? 
 You mean Metal Gear . 
 I remember hearing a lot about mergers and take-overs among the big weapons makers . 
 Black project ? 
 Bribes . 
 I don't give a crap about you and your company . 
 What's that ? 
 What kind of data ? 
 Can you walk ? 
 I have one more question .  Who or what was that ninja thing ?  It looked like you knew something . 
 Dark little secret ? 
 You know him ? 
 Naomi ? 
 What ?  Doesn't Metal Gear use currently existing technology ? 
 Huh ! ? 
 What are you talking about ! ? 
 What the hell ? 
 Colonel !  Are you listening ?  Now he's dead too ! 
 Don't lie to me ! 
 Some kind of poison ! ? 
 Damn ! 
 Can I trust her ? 
  . . . . . . 
 Naomi, what the hell was that ninja thing ? 
 A member of FOX-HOUND ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 Is that right ? 
 I was really impressed with the way you busted yourself out of there . 
 You're the Colonel's niece, Meryl, right ? 
 I'm the fool that your uncle sent all alone into the middle of this whole mess . 
 I appreciate your help from before .  But . . . I don't need lectures . You're just like your uncle, you know . 
 We go way back . 
 My name's not important . 
 That's what some people called me . 
 But I knew you were . 
 It's your eyes . 
 They're not soldiers eyes . 
 No, they're beautiful compassionate eyes . 
 Don't worry .  You'll land back on them once you meet me .  The reality is no match for the legend, I'm afraid . 
 Why did you look surprised when you saw my face ? 
  . . .You mean the terrorists leader, Liquid Snake ? 
 I have no family . 
 Who knows .  Why don't you ask him ?  But first I want some information .  You were involved in this excercise from the beginning . What exactly happened here ? 
 That's okay .  But what is this place ?  I don't think it is just a nuclear wepaons disposal facility . . . 
 This is a civilian base ? 
 Colonel ! 
 Why FOX-HOUND ? 
 But we must have fired nuclear warheads before .  Why just this time ? 
 Hmmm . . . sounds kind of fishy . . .  So what do you think the terrorists want ? 
 Oh yeah, that's when he gave you the detonation override keys, right ? 
 Amazing you were able to keep 'em hidden from the guards . 
 He's dead . . . 
 Heart attack .  Same as the DARPA Chief . 
 Yeah, was either of them sick or anything ? 
 Well, I don't believe in coincidences .  Something funny's going on . 
 Me neither . . . yet .  Do you know the person who designed Metal Gear ? 
 Yes .  Is he still alive ? 
 Second floor basement ? 
 So they'll need him alive until that's done anyway . 
 You're right .  In case we can't override the detonation code in time, I need to ask him how to destroy Metal Gear . 
 It won't be the first time . . . 
 What's the best way to get to the building where the Doctor is being held ? 
 What's the security level of the door there ? 
 Well, I've got to go save the Doctor .  You should go . . . 
 No way !  You're still too green .  I want you to hide somewhere . 
 Oh yes you are . 
 You pause for just one second in front of your enemy and it's all over !  Good luck doesn't last forever ! 
 Shooting at targets and shooting at living, breathing people are different . 
 So what now ?  You wanna quit ? 
 Listen, Meryl .  Everybody feels sick the first time they kill someone .  Unfortunately, killing is one of those things that gets easier the more you do it .  In a war, all of mankind's worst emotions, worst traits come out . It's easy to forget what a sin is in the middle of a battlefield . 
 You're just a little jumpy from the combat high .  The adrenaline in your blood is starting to whin out .  Just take it easy . 
 We'll talk about it later .  For now, just think about keeping yourself alive . 
 Okay, let me try to say this another way . . . Stay the hell out of my way . 
 Ha ha, I told you .  The real me is no match for the legend . 
 We'll link up after I grab the Doctor .  Then we'll take care of the detonation code override . 
 Be careful, okay ? 
 Thanks .  Where are you ? 
 Don't move around too much . 
 You won't be for long with the way you walk . 
 Oh . . . nothing . 
 Gas . . . 
 Wait !  You said you'd stay put and be a good girl ! 
 Don't get careless .  That is when things always turn sour . 
 These guys are proffesionals .  You're gonna get yourself killed . 
 Who are you ? 
 Deepthroat ?  The informant from the Watergate scandal ? 
 You're not using burst transmission .  Are you nearby ? 
 Who are you anyway ? 
 What ?  What are you talking about ? 
 Yeah .  There's lots of boxes piled up here, but . . . are they all warheads ? 
 They just leave them here ?  It's like President Baker said . . . totally careless . 
 But how ?  I can't reach it . 
 It looks like they were cut by some type of blade . 
 You're that ninja . 
 Who are you ? 
 What do you want ? 
 What is it ? Revenge ? 
 I need that man .  Keep your hands off him . 
 It can't be !  You were killed in Zanzibar . . . 
 What ! ?  Not again ! ! 
 What's happening ? 
 Grey Fox . . . Colonel, that ninja is Grey Fox .  No doubt about it . 
 And where is he now ? 
 And what about this soldier ? 
 And that was Grey Fox . . . 
 Naomi, why didn't you tell us about this sooner ? 
 Is that the only reason ? 
 From what I could tell, he didn't know who he was . 
 I'm not sure, but he seems intent on fighting me to the death . We'll meet again, I know it . 
 Hmmmmm . . . I'd rather not, but maybe that's what he wants . . . 
 How long are you going to stay in there ? 
 No, I'm not .  I always work alone . 
 C'mon, get out .  We can't stay here forver . 
 You're the Metal Gear shief engineer, Hal Emmerich, right ? 
 I heard about you from Meryl . 
 Sorry, but no .  There's something that I've got to do first . 
 Huh ?  Are you hurt ? 
 Well, if that's all, it's nothing to worry about . I want to ask you something .  I need information about Metal Gear . 
 Yeah .  What's Metal Gear really designed for ? 
 Liar !  I already know that Metal Gear is nothing more than a nuclear-equipped, walking death mobile . 
 The terrorists are planning to use Metal Gear to launch a nuclear missile . You telling me I didn't know ? 
 Wrong .  From the beginning, the purpose of this exercise was to test Metal Gear's nuclear launch capability using a dummy nuclear warhead .  The terrorists are just continuing the work you started . 
 I heard it directly from your boss, Baker . 
  . . .So you really didn't know ? 
 President Baker ? 
 A rail gun you said ? 
 Metal Gear's main funtion is to launch nuclear missiles .  You're sure you're not forgetting something ? 
 Yeah, but that's not all I think .  If Metal Gear fired only standard nuclear missiles, then they should already have all the practical data they need . 
 So they developed a new type of nuclear weapon in a VR testing lab, huh ? 
 So this exercise was designed to test the real thing ? 
 The day of the Hiroshima bomb . . . God's got a sense of humour all right . 
 That's enough crying .  Pull yourself together !  Where is Metal Gear ?  Where on this base are they keeping it ? 
 Where is that ? 
 The emergency override system for the detonation code is there too ? 
 Meryl's got the detonation override keys .  We'll link up with her . 
 On that leg of yours ?  You'll just slow me down . 
 I don't need you .  I just need your brain . 
 If you get a chance, try to escape .  When the coast is clear I'll try to contact you by Codec . 
 Okay . 
 I want you to hide somewhere and keep me informed .  You know this place well, don't you ? 
 Good .  But I want Meryl to watch after you too . 
 Meryl, the engineer's okay . 
 I want you to look after him .  Where are you now ? 
 Meryl !  What happened ! ? 
 Something's wrong . 
 What did she look like ? 
 A disguise ? 
 You were really looking . 
 Way of walking, huh ? 
 Where's that ? 
 You're not in pain, are you ? 
 You feel okay ?  Nothing bothering you ? 
 Oh nothing . . . . I'm glad you're okay . 
 I'm a little nervous .  Everyone else I've saved suddenly dies . 
 Forget it, Doctor . 
 Otacon ? 
 And Japanese cartoons played some part in that ? 
 That's what all scientists say . 
 Just sounds like a childish excuse to me . 
 Whatever .  All I want from you is information . 
 You're Meryl ?  There's no way you could pass for a man for long . 
 I had no idea you were so feminine . 
 Same smart mouth .  You're Meryl all right .  Are you hurt ? 
 So why'd you change ?  You'd be better off dressed like one of them . 
 What's that mark ? 
 There are no heroes in war .  All the heroes I know are either dead . . . or in prison .  One or the other . 
 I'm just a man who's good at what he does .  Killing .  There's no winning or losing for a mercenary .  The only winners in war are the people . 
 I've never fought for anyone but myself . I've got no purpose in life .  No ultimate goal . 
 It's only when I'm cheating death on the battlefield .  The only time I feel truly alive . 
 Why didn't you contact me ? 
 Is that all ? 
 I never forget a lady . 
 Yeah, you've got a great butt . 
 On the battlefield you never think about what's next . 
 No progress . 
 Somebody's got to prevent them from launching a nuclear missile . 
  . . .we override the detonation code .  You got the card keys from Baker ? 
 Where are the others ?  There should be three keys . 
 Where could the other two be ? 
 Metal Gear is in an underground maintenance base to the north . 
 You'll just slow me down .  You don't have enough battle experience . 
 And what if you do ? 
 I don't like to waste bullets . 
 You wanted to follow in your father's footsteps ? 
 So are you a soldier yet ? 
 Take a good look .  You won't get anothert chance for a while . You should wash your face while you're at it .  This isn't a training exercise .  Our lives are riding on this .  There are no heroes or heroins .  If you lose, you're worm food . 
 Is that FAMAS functional ? 
 Where'd ya' get that Desert Eagle ? 
 Hmmm .  So I got a leftover, huh .  Isn't that gun a little big for a girl . 
 C'mon .  Use my  .45 . 
 Looks like he must have been guarding someplace important . 
 What happened to the music ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Are you okay ?  What happened ? 
 What the ! ? 
 What's wrong ? 
 Who's that ! ? 
 Optic camouflage, huh ?  I hope that's not your only trick . 
 Meryl . 
 Stop ! Meryl ! ! 
 Colonel, your niece is going to be okay . 
 Now that Mantis is beaten, Meryl's brainwashing is going to wear off, right Naomi ? 
 I don't want to see any woman die right in front of me . 
 It's okay, Colonel . . . she's right . 
 A strong man doesn't need to read the future .  He makes his own . 
 Why are you telling me this ? 
 Are you saying you burned your village down to bury your past ? 
 Let him talk .  He doesn't have much time left . 
 Meryl's ? 
 A large place ? 
 What is it ? 
 Okay . 
 Let's go, Meryl . 
 Meryl ? 
 If you're going to doubt yourself, I'll leave you here . 
 Never doubt yourself .  Just let it make you stronger .  Learn something from it . 
 What ! ? 
 What ?  What's the problem now ? 
 Name means nothing on the battlfield . 
 OLd enough to know what death looks like . 
 No, but I was raised by many people . 
 I've never been interested in anyone else's life . . . 
 Other people just complicate my life .  I don't like to get involved . 
 C'mon . . . let's go . 
 The radar isn't working .  And since we can't use the mine detector either . . . 
 How did you know where the mines were ? 
 Well . . . a little bit . 
 Meryl ! ! 
 Meryl, get down ! ! ! 
 Meryl ! ! 
 Meryl . . . 
 Don't worry, Meryl .  It's me they want . 
 Damn ! ! 
 No ! 
 Don't move ! 
 Quiet down !  Save your strength ! 
 Sniper's usually work in pairs, but this one's alone, huh ? 
 Maybe so, but Meryl can't hold out that long . . . 
 There's no where to hide between here and the tower . . . she must be on the second floor of the tower . 
 Colonel !  Take it easy . 
 I'm going to save Meryl no matter what it takes . 
 What's wrong, Naomi ? 
 Trying to say that I'm only interested in saving my own skin ? 
 I don't know what the hell my genes look like and I don't care . I operate on instinct . 
 I'm going to save Meryl .  I don't need an excuse . 
 And I'm not doing it for someone else either .  I'm going to save Meryl by myself .  Colonel, don't worry ! 
 A lady sniper, huh ? 
 I'll die after I kill you . 
 Uuuuhh ! ! 
 Meryl . . . 
 Not bad .  I caught a nice nap on this revolving bed of yours .  Too bad I was sleeping alone . 
 Where are my things ? 
 So, Metal Gear is armed with a new type of nuclear warhead, huh ? 
 The Colonel ? 
 What if I did ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Is Meryl okay ? 
 Hell if I know . 
 Looks like I've got a roommate .  The DARPA Chief ! ?  Whew . . .what a stench ! 
 I've been better . 
  . . . . . . . . 
 C'mon, Colonel .  Why don't you stop playing dumb ?  I'm sorry about Meryl but I want the lies to end now . 
 Metal Gear was designed to launch a new type of nuclear warhead, wasn't it ? 
 You knew it all along, didn't you ? 
 Why did you try to hide it ? 
 Can't tell the grunts, huh ?   . . .You've changed a lot .  Metal Gear . . . secret advanced nuclear weapons research . . .  Does the White House know about this ?  How deep does it go ? 
 Plausible deniability, huh ? 
 I get it .  That's the reason for the deadline . 
 So patriotism is your excuse for circumventing the Constitution ? 
 Why should I ? 
 In that case, tell me the truth about this new type of nuclear warhead . 
 I don't believe you .If the situation is so serious, why don't you give in to their demands ?  Let them have Big Boss's remains . 
 Or is there some reason that you can't do that ?  Something you haven't told me about ? 
 And that's the only reason ? 
 Huh !  The hell with you ! 
 The corpse of the DARPA Chief is lying right here next to me . 
 But it's strange .  He looks and smells like he's been dead for days . All his blood's been drained out too . 
 I have no idea . 
 Right .  But he's already started to decompose . 
 SOmething in his blood that they wanted ? 
 I'm afraid so .  It looks like they've got both codes and are nearly ready to launch . 
 It seems there's some type of emergency override device that can cancel out the detonation code .  It's a countermeasure that ArmsTech installed secretly .  You have to unlock it with three special card keys . 
 I've got one of them .  I don't know where the other two are . Besides, I'm locked up here . 
  . . . . . . .  Naomi, please talk to me .  Say something to take my mind off the pain . 
 Anything . 
 Please . . . tell me about yourself . 
 Any family ? 
 I don't have any family .  No wait, there was a man who said he was my father . . . 
 Dead .  By my own hand . 
 That's what he said .  That's all I know . 
 Yup . 
 He wanted it .  Besides, some people just need killing . . . 
 Yup .  That's the trauma that Mantis was talking about .  The one we share in common . 
 Let's just say that I needed to be alone for a while and Alaska was the perfect place . . . 
 Where is he ? 
 I'm sorry . 
 After you've been through as many wars as me, it's hard to trust anyone . 
 Roy Campbell . . . 
 No, there was another . . . Frank Jaeger . 
 I learned a lot from him . 
 That's true .  We did .  In Zanzibar .  But it was nothing personal . We were just proffesionals on opposite sides, that's all . 
 Hard to believe ?  War is no reason to end a friendship . 
 I first met him on the battlefield .  He was being held a prisoner of Outer Heaven .  But he didn't look like a prisoner to me .  He was always so cool and precise .  I was still green and he showed me the ropes . 
 No .  We never talked about our personal lives .  Sort of an unwritten rule .  The nest time I saw him on the battlefield, we were enemies .  We were fighting barehanded in a minefield .  I know it sounds strange to most people .  But we were just two soldiers doing our jobs .  It's like a sport . 
 You're right .  We are animals . 
 I don't know . 
 You really like talking about genes, Naomi .  Why did you get into genetic research anyway ? 
 So you studied about DNA ? 
 Memory is stored in DNA ? 
 So what about my fate ? You know my DNA sequence, don't you ? 
 Of course not .  You're a scientist, not a fortune-teller . 
 Otacon, are you still okay ? 
 I have a favor to ask .  I need your help . 
 I've been captured .  I'm locked up here in this cell . 
 There's a big torture machine nearby . 
 Thanks . 
 Where ? 
 Otacon ! 
 Hurry !  Get me out of here ! 
 Hurry up ! 
 Because of him . 
 If you don't hurry up and get me out of here, I'll be laying next to him . 
 So what are you doing here then ? 
 What's that . 
 Why ? 
 Sounds like Stockholm Syndrome to me . 
 Wake up you idiot !  She's the one who shot Meryl ! 
 They're planning to launch a nuke !  I've got to stop them ! 
 First, you have to get me out of here ! 
 That guard's got the key .  You'll have to take him out ! 
 You have to ! ! 
 Wait ! 
 Meryl . . . 
 Don't worry, Meryl .  It's me they want . 
 Damn ! ! 
 No ! 
 Don't move ! 
 Quiet down !  Save your strength ! 
 Colonel, I'm sorry . . . 
 I wasn't able to protect her . 
 Colonel . . . 
 No .  You're wrong . 
 Meryl thought she had to become a soldier . . . thought it was the only way .  She said she thought it woul;d bring her closer to her dead father . 
 She wasn't ready for real combat .  I shouldn't have pushed her so hard . . . . It's all my fault . 
 Master . . . 
 Mei Ling . . . 
 You're right .  Meryl would say the same thing . 
 What ? 
 Yes, she's special .  There aren't many women like her around . 
 She's the Colonel's niece . . . and a combat buddy . 
 This is like a police interrogation . 
 The genes ?  What are you talking about, Colonel ? 
 Is that right ? 
 Damn ! 
 Liquid ? 
 It's a long way down . If only I had a rope .  I should be able to use that rope I got . . . 
 If I stay here, I'm finished . 
 Otacon ? How'd you get here ? 
 You were watching ? 
 How did you get up here ? 
 The 1st floor of the circular staircase was destroyed . 
 The elevator was working ? 
 No . . .you're wrong .  In the movies, the hero always saves the girl . . . 
 That's what you came to ask ? 
 What are you trying to say ? 
 Yeah . . .I do .  I think at any time, any place . . . people can fall in love with each other .  But . . . if you love someone, you have to be able to protect them . . . 
 I have a favor to ask . 
 Don't worry . It'll be easy . 
 I don't want you to either . 
 The elevator is stopped down there . I want you to get it to move . You see ? 
 It was working before, but now it isn't . 
 Can you fix it ? 
 I've got to go and swat a noisy fly . 
 You really look like hell . Are you okay ? 
 Strange logic . I'm counting on you . 
 Why are you calling me brother ?  Who the hell are you ! ? 
 What ! ? 
 See you in hell . . .Liquid .  That takes care of the cremation . 
 You fixed it ? 
 Is that so ? Okay . 
 Oh, I had to take out that helicopter . 
 Listen . I just want to make sure again .  This is the way to get to where Metal Gear is being stored ? 
 Okay . Find a safe place to hide out for a while .  I'm going underground . 
 And stay outta my way . Don't try to be a hero or anything . 
 What ? 
 Yeah, so ? 
 Hey . This isn't first grade math class . 
 Yeah ? 
  . . . . . . . . . ? 
 When you were riding on it, did the weight limit warning go off ? 
 How much do you weigh ? 
 It would take at least five people to go over that limit . . . 
 Otacon ! Were there any other stealth prototypes ? 
 So . . .this isn't stealth camouflage then . . . 
 Someone's aiming at me . . . in the middle of this blizzard . . . 
  Wolf ?  . . .Sniper Wolf ? 
 Otacon . . . You sound like you're happy . 
 So then what is it ? 
 Are you insane ! ? 
 Listen to me, kid . She's a merciless killer . 
 You're pretty good if you can hit me in this storm . 
 It's a mistake for a sniper to reveal her location . 
 Now I'm gonna pay you back for Meryl . . . 
 A Kurd ? So that's why you're called Wolf . . . 
 Saladin ?  . . .You mean Big Boss ? 
 Wolf . . . you spared Meryl's life . 
 Rest easy .  You'll die as the proud wolf you are . 
 What is it ? 
 Returning it to it's owner .  I don't need a hankercheif . 
 I don't have any more tears to shed . 
 I'm going to the underground base .  We're out of time . 
 You'll have to protect yourself now .  Don't trust anyone . 
 If I can't stop Metal Gear, this whoe place will probably be bombed to hell . 
 We might not meet again . 
 You can leave any time .  Get a headstart . . . a headstart on your new life . 
 If we make it through this, I'll tell you . 
 What about her ? 
 Don't worry .  The monitor's off . 
 What's up ? 
 I didn't know that .  What's your point ? 
 Yeah ? 
 Yeah, what about it ? 
 What did you say ? 
 She lied ? 
 Rediculous ! 
 Yeah . . . 
 But . . . 
 Are you saying that Naomi might be behind it ? 
 Could it be . . . ? 
 You were the one in the M1 tank ?  Must have been a tight fit for a big boy like you . 
 Am I hallucinating ? 
 I . . . I can't move . . . 
 I don't have any crows in my family tree . 
 You want to pull each other's ears ? 
 This isn't glorious .  It's just plain killing .  Violence isn't a sport ! 
 Why ? 
 The Angel of Death ?  But why go to so much trouble ?  Why impersonate the Chief ? 
 What are you trying to say ? 
 Master ? 
 Colonel, is Naomi there ? 
 Yeah .  Go on, Master . . . 
  . . .I don't want to believe it either .  But she is working for FOX-HOUND . 
 What do you mean ! ? 
 I knew it .  You're hiding something . 
 I don't have any time left for you . 
 What's wrong ?  Did you find a good place to hide ? 
 How do you know that ? 
 Right in front of Metal Gear . . . but it's strange . 
 There's nobody here . . . no guards, nobody patrolling . . . it's too quiet . 
 What should I do ? 
 But I've only got one of the three keys .  And besides that, like Ocelot said, there's some trick to using the keys . . . 
 You got some kind of plan ? 
 Baker's files ?  Don't you need a password ? 
 Are you a hacker ? 
 Does it look like you can get in ? 
 I'm counting on you . . . 
 How's it going ? 
 Do you think you'll break in soon ? 
 Okay, keep trying . 
 You got past security ? 
 Great .  So whaddya got ? 
 So what about the PAL override system that Baker talked about ? 
 That's what I need to know ! 
 What ? 
 Pretty sneaky . 
 I can't wait to hear this . 
 You mean it won't show up on radar ? 
 Why weren't they able to develope one until now ? 
 Oh yeah, that makes sense . 
 An invisible nuclear warhead . . . 
 We learned that lesson in the Gulf War . 
 It's the ultimate weapon .  And from a political point of view, it avoids the problem of nuclear reduction and nuclear inspections . Colonel, is this true ?  Are you listening ? 
 If word of this got out, it could delay the signing of the Start 3 Treaty and cause a huge international incident . 
 Did you know this, Colonel ? 
 You've changed, Colonel . 
 You mean they ran a computer model ? 
 What were the results of the excercise ? 
 It was .  President Baker gave me an optical disc with all of the test data . 
 No, Ocelot took it from me . 
 So you think they can do it ? 
 Did you find out how to override it yet ? 
 We're counting on you . . . 
 Liquid ! 
 One billion dollars ! 
 Big Boss's dream . . . 
 Meryl . . . she's alive . 
 Great job . 
 They've finished inputting the PAL codes . So how do we deactivate them ? 
 Only once, huh . 
 But it takes three keys, right ! ? I've only got one of them ! 
 What are you talking about ! ? 
 Shape memory alloy ? 
 This card key ? 
 So this key is actually three keys in one . . .clever . 
 I see them . 
 Okay, I got it . First I change the shape of the card and then I input them in order, right ? 
 Damn ! ! The key fell in the drainage ditch ! 
 Okay, that takes care of PAL code number one . . . Now PAL number two . . . freeze the key . 
 Then you should talk to the Colonel . He's looking into it . 
 Okay it's off . No one else can hear us . Go ahead . 
 Okay, so what's up ? 
 Yeah . . . 
 An assassination weapon ? 
 No . . . 
  . . .Liquid and others were talking about it . . . 
 What are you trying to say ? 
 What is ! ? 
 Yeah . . . ? 
 No . . . You're telling me that Naomi was behind it ? 
  . . .The nanomachines . 
  . . .Does the Colonel know ? 
 Okay . I'll ask him myself . Colonel, what's new with the Naomi situation ? 
 Arrest ? 
 Are you sure ? 
 What kind of interrogation ? 
 Call me if you find out anything . 
 Naomi . . .I can't believe it . 
 Listen . I've got bigger things to worry about . 
 All I can do is leave it up to the Colonel . 
 Naomi ! ?  . . .what the hell ! ? 
 Naomi, is what the Colonel says true ? 
 Cause you want to know yourself, right ? 
 Naomi . . . 
 Rhodesia ? What's now known as Zimbabwe ? 
 Naomi, you're too worried about the past . Isn't it enough to understand who you are now ? 
 Your big brother ? 
 What ! ? 
 Gray Fox ? 
 And he brought you back to America ? 
 So were your prayers answered ? 
 To kill me ?  Is that all you cared about ? 
 Do you still hate me ? 
 What about Liquid and the others ? 
 Naomi . . .you didn't kill that doctor too, did you ?  The one that used Gray Fox for his genome experiments . . . 
 So that Ninja . . .I mean Gray Fox . . . he's come here to kill me ? 
  . . .Fox . . .no . . . Naomi, tell me something . . . 
 Those enzymes recognize the target's DNA ? 
 And then . . .they cause a heart attack ? 
 Apoptosis . . .you mean the heart cells commit suicide . . . Naomi . . . 
  . . .You must have programmed that thing to kill me too, right ? Do I still have time ? Naomi, I don't blame you for wanting me dead .  But I can't go yet . I still have a job to do . 
 You weren't ? 
 What happened to Naomi ! ? What did she mean when she said that FoxDie was a part of this operation ! ?  Colonel, let me talk to her ! 
  . . .you double crossed me ! 
 Okay, there goes PAL code number two . Next comes PAL number three . . . warm the key . 
 No ! Why ! 
 Master, what's going on ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 You mean you had this planned from the beginning ? Just to get me to input the detonation code ! ? 
 Who the hell are you ! ? 
 Ace-in-the-hole ? 
 Who are you anyway ! ? 
 Where are you ? 
 So who is it ? 
 Liquid ! ? How the . . . ! ? 
 Liquid ! ! 
 Why did you disguise yourself as Master ? 
 What the hell are you talking about ! ? 
 What ? 
 A diversion ? 
 You don't mean . . . 
 Fox Die !  . . .It can't be ! Are you telling me Naomi was working with the Pentagon ? 
 What ? 
 I wonder . . . maybe they arrested her so they could find out the answer to that . 
 There's a vaccine ? 
 Why is that ? 
 A bug in the virus' programming ? 
 So it's true . . .you and I are . . . 
 I was the favorite, huh . 
  . . .So that's why you're so obsessed with Big Boss . Some warped kind of love . 
 You're just like Naomi . 
 Damn ! ! 
  It's moving . . . 
 How do I stop it ? 
 Did that do it ! ? Damn ! ! ! 
 Gray Fox ! ! 
 So it is you ! ? 
 Fox, why ! ? What do you want from me ! ? 
 Fox, stay out of this . . . What about Naomi ? She's hell bent on taking revenge for you . 
 You're the only one who can stop her . 
 Why ? 
 Fox . . . 
 Fox ! 
 Fox ! 
 He destroyed the radome . . . 
 Fox ! 
 Fooooooox ! ! ! 
 Ooooh ! Uuuuff ! 
 Liquid . . . you're still alive . . . 
 Too bad . It looks like your revolution was a failure . 
 Fighting ? What are you really after ? 
 That was Big Boss's fantasy . 
 But as long as there are people, there will always be war . 
 Is that the only reason ? 
 I don't want that kind of world ! 
  . . . . . . 
 What ! 
 That was . . . 
 You're wrong ! 
 Created ? 
 Big Boss . . . 
 Super Baby Method ? 
 Octuplets . . . 
  . . . . . . . 
 What ? 
 The Genome Soldiers ! ? 
 Sacrifices ? 
 Hah . Everyone knows that the Gulf War Syndrome was caused by exposure to depleted uranium used in anti-tank rounds . 
 So then . . . the so called Gulf War Babies that have been reported by Gulf War veterans are . . . 
 So the Genome Soldiers mean that the experiments were a success ? 
 What ! ? 
   ! ! ! 
 You want Big Boss's DNA so you can save your family ? It's very  touching . 
 You're telling me that your genes are ordering you to save the Genome Soldiers ? 
 Meryl ! ? Is she alive ? 
 Meryl . . . 
 I have a name ! 
 Let Meryl go ! 
  . . .You're talking about FoxDie ? 
 Colonel ! Can you hear me ? 
 What is the Pentagon trying to do ! ? Colonel ! Colonel ! Answer me ! 
 What for ? 
 What ! ? 
 What ? ! Metal Gear is destroyed . Tell the Secretary of Defense ! 
 He's going to drop a nuclear bomb to vaporize all the evidence along with anyone who knows anything . . . 
 How ? 
 But Colonel, if you do that . . . 
 Those bastards . . . 
 Are you sure ?  . . .It'll be bad for you . 
 Colonel . . . 
 Mei Ling, what happened to the Colonel ! ? 
 What happened ! ? 
 Put the Colonel back on ! 
 Ridiculous ! 
 You bastard . . . ! 
 The President ordered this ? 
 How do you plan on explaining a nuclear attack on Alaska to the media ? 
  . . .Smart . You'll be murdering everyone here . The scientists, the Genome Army, everyone . . . 
 So you didn't mean to kill the DARPA Chief after all ? 
 And you could care less about what happens to everybody else, huh ? 
 What are you talking about ? 
 I don't have it . 
 Meryl ?   . . . .Meryl ?   Meeeeryyyyylll ! 
 Forgive me .  Damn !  I gave into my fear .  I gave into my pain .  I sold your life to save my oen . . .  I'm a loser .  I'm not the hero you thought I was .  I'm nothing !  Meryl, I'm sorry !  Forgive me . 
 Otacon ? 
  . . .Because of me . . . . 
 What the hell do you know ?  Meryl's dead .  I lost . 
 Together forever ? 
 Otacon . . . you've changed . 
 Okay .  Let's go !  Meryl, I hope you're still watching me .  Maybe I can prove myself to you after all . 
 C'mon, hustle ! 
 My sneaking suit ! 
 Otacon, are you okay ? 
 Otacon, can you move ? 
 What happened to Liquid ? 
 Liquid is dead . . . Uh oh ! 
 If he's dead, that means . . . . 
 What happened to the air raid ? No stealth bombers in sight . 
 Colonel ! 
 Colonel, what happened ? 
 Arrested ? 
 Acting alone ? What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike ? 
 I see . . . 
 I wonder about that . 
 Colonel, about Meryl . . . 
  . . . . . Colonel 
 What ! ? 
 Colonel, I . . . . 
 It's okay, Colonel . 
 Oh that's right . 
 Me neither . I better not show my face around here . 
 That's not too far from the truth . 
 Okay, Roy . Are you going to be okay ? 
 The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon . They won't be able to follow us . 
 Don't worry . I'll pay you a visit sometime . 
 Roy, just tell me one thing . 
 About Fox Die . 
 What about me ? It killed Liquid . . . 
 How is she ? 
 Naomi . . . 
 I'm sorry . . . but he had one last message he wanted to say to you . He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your own life . 
 Yeah . He also said he'll always love you . . . Naomi, your brother just saved you, me and the whole world . He fought with every ounce of strength in his body . 
 Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too . What about me ? When am I gonna go ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yeah, so when's mine up ? 
  . . . . . . . . . . 
 Until today, I've lived only for myself .  Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life . 
 I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face .  I don't know, maybe it's written into my genes . 
 I want to enjoy life .  I really do .  How about you, Otacon ? 
 So what are you going to do ?  Continue your research ? 
 Sounds good . . . 
 You and I are more alike than I thought . . . 
 You're giving up your stealth camo ? 
 No thanks .  I'd rather do it myself . 
 My real name is David, Otacon . 
 Oh, that's right . . . Hal .  Hal and Dave ?  That's a good one .  Ha ha ha ha ha . . . Maybe we should take a trip to Jupiter . . . 
 Hmmm . I think it's time for me to look for a new path in life . 
 A new purpose . 
 I'll find it .  I know I'll find it . 
 Meryl ? Meryl ! ? 
 Meryl ? Meryl, are you okay ? 
 Meryl, it must have been terrible . . . 
 Torture ? 
 You're a strong woman . 
  . . .I'm sorry . 
 Otacon, good news ! Meryl's okay . 
 I got some bad news too . We're about to be bombed . 
 Is there a way out of here ? 
 The door in front ? 
 How about the security ? 
 What are you going to do ? 
 Are you crazy ! 
 But . . . 
 Otacon ? 
 Otacon, this is a hardened shelter, but they're going to use a surface piercing nuclear bomb . It won't hold . 
  . . . . . . . . 
 Good . Don't die on me . 
 I will . . . 
 Thanks . 
  . . .I believe in you . 
 Let's get the hell out of here . 
 He's . . . He's . . . fighting right now . . . With his old self . . . to be the man he wants to be . 
 Yeah, and I don't want it to be in vain . 
 Meryl . 
 Meryl . It's started . . . 
 It looks like we're not gonna have a love scene after all . 
 Let's get out of here ! 
 There's my Sneaking Suit ! 
 Meryl, are you okay ? 
 Meryl, can you move ? 
 What happened to Liquid ? 
 Liquid is dead . . . Uh oh ! 
 Die . . . If he's dead, that means . . . 
 What happened to the air raid ? No Stealth bombers in sight . 
 Colonel ! 
 Colonel, what happened ? 
 Arrested ? 
 Acting alone ? What happened to the air raid and the nuclear strike ? 
 I see . . . 
 I wonder about that . 
 Colonel, you can rest easy . Meryl's fine . 
 It's okay, Colonel . 
 Oh that's right . 
 Me neither . I better not show my face around here . 
 That's not too far from the truth . 
 Dr . Hal Emmerich should be somewhere on the base . I want someone to bring him in . 
 Okay, Roy . Are you going to be okay ? 
 The battery on these nanomachines will run out soon . They won't be able to follow us . 
 Don't worry . I'll pay you a visit sometime . 
 Roy, just tell me one thing . 
 About Fox Die . 
 What about me ? It killed Liquid . . . 
 How is she ? 
 Naomi . . . 
 I'm sorry . . . but he had one last message he wanted to say to you . He told me to tell you to forget about him and to go on with your own life . 
 Yeah . He also said he'll always love you . . . Naomi, your brother just saved you, me and the whole world . He fought with every ounce of strength in his body . 
 Naomi, Liquid died from Fox Die too . What about me ? When am I gonna go ? 
 What do you mean ? 
 Yeah, so when's mine up ? 
  . . . . . . . . . . 
 Let's keep it . As a reminder . 
 A reminder of how to live . Until today, I've lived only for myself . Survival has been the only thing I cared about in my life . 
 I only felt truly alive when I was staring Death in the face . I don't know, maybe it's written into my genes . 
 Maybe it's time I live for someone else . 
 Yeah . Someone like you . . . Maybe that's the real way to live . 
 David . My name is David . . . 
 Hmmm . I think it's time we look for a new path in life . 
 A new purpose . 
 We'll find it . I know we'll find it . 
 Caribou . To the Aleutians, the Caribou is a symbol of life . It'll be spring here soon . . . 
 Yeah . Spring brings new life to everything . It's a time for hope . I've lived here a long time . . . But Alaska has never looked more beautiful . The sky . . . the sea . . . the caribou . . . and most of all . . . You . . . 
 C'mon . Let's enjoy life . . . 
 This is Snake . Do you read me, Otacon ? 
 The stealth camo's busted . Landing impact . 
 Right . I didn't plan on relying on this gadget anyway . 
 I'm happy as long as no one gives me any more unwanted gifts . 
 And I can't say I miss the chattering nanny . 
 Diverting toys from the SSCEN (U .S . Army Soldier Systers Center) again ? Give her a message from me
 All Ocelot's doing . . . 
 Not exactly a classified weapon for today's nuclear powers . 
 That explains why this one is under Marine Corps jurisdiction . 
 A little reconnaissance, huh ? 
 All right . I'll head to the bridge ASAP . 
 Don't worry . I know the drill -- we're not terrorists . 
 Recognized, but still fringe, Otacon . 
 M9 . 
 It's better than scavenging on mission site . Good suppressor too . 
 It's kind of a lucky charm . 
 They don't look armed . . . 
 Sure, if it comes to that, a little beauty sleep never hurt anyone . By the way, Otacon, are you sure of this intelligence ? 
 No traces ? 
 We can't rule out the possibility that this is a trap . There's a high price on our heads, you know . 
 I hope so . 
 They don't seem anything but civilians from here . 
 The waterline is too high . . .According to the navigational plans, this ship should have discharged its cargo upriver . 
 A Metal Gear in the holds will weigh down a ship a bit, I'd say . The military trains you to watch for threats from the stern on a boat . That's SOP for Counter-terror ops too . Security should be tighter . 
 Where's the target ? 
 Looks like there are a few entry ways into the crew quarters . 
 A chopper . Wha-- ! 
 Looks like were not the only ones after Metal Gear tonight . 
 Affirmative . Probably another cavalry . . . 
 What's their game ? Hijack ? 
 Otacon, how many men do you need to take over a tanker of this size ? 
 AKS-74u ? 
 Russians ? 
 No Marine barber touched that head of hair . 
 I'm transmitting the photo . Let's try to get a ID on him ASAP . 
 Looks like the tanker's theirs now . 
 KA-60 . Kasatka ? 
 We need to get a fix on who they are . 
 Not necessarily . It could be the KA-62, the civil model . 
 All right . I'll do my best . 
 How can I check in and save my progress ? 
 Got it . 
 I'll be in touch . 
 So it is the Kasatka . . . Russian choppers . . . 
 I'm looking at it -- 35 degrees longitude, latitude around 58 . 
  ! ? 
 Hm ? 
 Freeze ! 
 Hands over your head ! Now ! 
 Toss your gun overboard ! Slowly . 
 A woman . . . ?  Show your face . 
 Who are you ? 
 I said, don't move ! 
 I'm a nomad too . 
 What else do you have there ? Take the knife and toss it . 
 Not there . Toss it overboard ! Hold that position . Now, turn around . 
 Scout knife with a surprise -- you a Spetsnaz ? 
 Hmm . . . 
 CYPHER ! ? 
 Otacon, the ship appears to be under their control . The men have Russian gear, but I haven't been able to find out anything else about their origin . 
 You do ? 
 Who is he ? 
 Gurlukovich . ! One of Ocelot's allies ? 
 They're after Metal Gear . . . 
 You could say that . I saw a surveillance remote just now, it looked like the Cypher . 
 No, Army . 
 You're right, this isn't going to be simple . 
 What ? 
 How did you find out, then ? 
 Anonymous ? You've never trusted those -- why would you start now ? 
 You've never mentioned her before . So . . . ? 
 Emma Emmerich ? 
 When was the last time you saw her ? 
 You think it's a trap ? To lure us out here . . . ? 
 Okay . . . 
 I've got a light-equipped USP; I can take them on now . There's no ammo, but it takes a 9mm, just like the Marines' M9 . I'll find those somewhere around here . 
 I hear you . 
 I'm not in the mood to go sleep with the fishes . There are too many sensors . Looks like I'll have to find another way . 
 It's taking longer than I expected . We've already passed the Verrazano Bridge . 
 They may be planning to change course . 
 The exits to the deck are all sealed . 
 If they get Metal Gear, we're going right off the fringe . 
 The men down here are definitely Marines . 
 I'm not interested in fighting these guys . The weapons won't do me much good here . 
 No . I'll have to go around to the bow . They have some serious defenses here . I doubt the recent arrivals want to blast their way through the Marines either . 
 I don't know . . . Not the beach, that's for sure . 
 Marking ? 
 All right . 
 Just spit it out . I'm used to things going wrong . 
 Who ? 
 Could it have something to do with that Cypher we saw ? 
 Instead of using the Codec ? 
 Why bother with anything that complicated . . . 
 OK, OK . So all I have to do is push the Action button in front of the computer once I have the pictures, right ? 
 How much time do I have ? 
 A seven-minute time limit, huh ? 
 With these kinds of odds, I won't be making any sudden moves . But that doesn't mean we can just let Metal Gear be hijacked . 
 All right . We'll deal with the rest when we get there . 
 Metal Gear ! ? 
 So this is the new Metal Gear . . . 
 Gurlukovich . . . 
 OCELOT ! ! 
 Who are you ? 
 Liquid ? 
  . . . 
 Liquid's arm ? 
 Otacon, we have a problem . . . 
 Of course . 
 Do we have an ID ? 
 What are their demands ? 
 Thirty billion dollars ! ? What makes them think they can get that much ? 
 Hostages, huh ? 
 The most important person --  ? 
 The President ! 
 And the crude will ignite, turning the Manhattan Harbor into an inferno . 
 Is this a joint effort ? 
 This is Snake . I am now inside Strut A of Shell 1 . 
 We're in luck . Looks like there are no sentries posted here . 
 The lights on the plant's struts are functioning . I won't have to use the IR goggles . 
 There was a brand-new hole cut through the oil fence . There's someone else besides me that wanted to get in badly . 
 What about SEAL Team 10 ? 
 It doesn't matter -- saved us the trouble of getting rid of him ourselves . 
 There a band of lunatics to begin with . Nothing they do should come as a surprise . 
 You think he was working for them ? 
 Yes . . . The man in the Sneaking Suit . 
 But FOXHOUND was disbanded 4 years ago . So it must be -- the Patriots . What about the damage to Shell 2 ? 
 Seal the connecting pathway Shells 1 and 2 . 
 Any effect on . . .it ? 
 What about the President ? 
 Make sure you keep him alive until then . 
 What about the unit's activation ? 
 The usual method I assume ? 
 Hmm . . .only a few more steps to Outer Heaven . 
 I'm having the matter looked into . 
 Enough ! I let you both in when no one else would . You think any government would have you two as irregulars in this political climate ? The worst kind of wetworks maybe -- but even that's doubtful . I recommend against switching camps . You've nowhere left to go . 
 It's happening again ? 
 How much do you think we spent on that arm in Leyon ?  The best transplant surgery team in the world . 
 Ocelot, I leave this place in your hands . I have the intruder to take care of . 
 What a pleasant surprise -- brother . 
 Don't say you've forgotten me -- Snake . 
 No, not me . There are still too many things I need to do . 
 Legend ? A legend is nothing but fiction . Someone tells it, someone else remembers, everybody passes it on . 
 There's something my best friend said to me once . 
 We're not tools of the government or anyone else . Fighting was the only thing I was good at, but . . . At least I always fought for what I believed in . . . 
 That's all there is to it . 
 We work on our own . But it's a cause worth fighting for . 
 That's the way I used to look at it, four years ago . I was holed up in the middle of nowhere in Alaska, drinking too much . 
 We need to remember -- to spread the word -- to fight for change . And that's what keeps me alive . 
 I'm not as arrogant as that . 
 Looks like the terrorists have his sister in the Big Shell . We're here on our own, not under anyone's orders . We have our own battles . Otacon's here for someone -- I'm not . 
 What's your status, Raiden ? 
 What about the nuclear strike code sequence ! ? 
 Then the enemy's lost their nuclear strike capability -- 
 Or maybe they've found a more effective weapon within Arsenal Gear . 
 Yeah . . . 
 You never asked . 
 You mean, did I know that the Big Shell, a fully functional environmental cleanup facility, was designed to camouflage Arsenal Gear ? Yeah, I did . 
 It took a while, but we uncovered the info around the time you took out that mad bomber . 
 There's no doubt that Arsenal Gear is being built here . . .then it was all set up two years ago on that day -- all of it . 
 I took these photos two years ago . 
 That's right . Otacon . Me . We were used . 
 Yeah ? Well I doubt it accurately simulates the events of that actual mission . 
 I'd infiltrated the dummy tanker to obtain proof that a Metal Gear was under development . Shortly after I made it aboard, an armed group led  by Colonel Gurlukovich raided the ship and gained control . 
 Yeah . And him . . . 
 A man that was supposed to be dead . Their target was also Metal Gear RAY . But Ocelot eliminated Colonel Gurlukovich and Marine Commander Scott Dolph -- and he hijacked RAY . 
 I don't know what kind of deal was going down . All I remember is what Ocelot said at the time -- something about taking it back . Ocelot then sank the tanker along with the soldiers of the Marine Corps . . . 
 Otacon managed to have a small boat ready for me . 
 It turned out that the whole thing was a setup to lure us . 
 And we fell for it -- two more puppets in their show . 
 Forget it . We're wasting time . We can figure this out later . The nuclear strike's been prevented, but Arsenal still has a massive payload of missiles to deal with . 
 Raiden -- you've got to find Emma . 
 Whatever her reasons, we need her in order to stop Arsenal . 
 Sorry, kid . Emma's rescue is up to you . 
 I suggest that you drum the map of the building into your head, 'cause you won't have time to look at it when you try to bring Emma out . 
 I covered most of the core when I had to take out the C4's . . . if there's anything you need to ask me, call me on the Codec . 
 Yeah, I heard . The hostage rescue's gonna have to wait . 
 We'll secure the Computer Room . 
 Can't your partner do it ? 
 That's why we need her . 
 We can talk about this later . Raiden, I think you'd better get moving, Emma's in the Locker Room to the north, right ? 
 Raiden, we've infiltrated the Computer Room . What's your situation ? 
 Shell 1's deserted . Looks like everybody's aboard Arsenal . 
 Alright -- that's enough ! 
 I'm a friend of Otacon's, Emma . 
 Enough with the sibling rivalry . 
 We haven't got time for this ! Raiden ! Get her over here, right now . 
 Most of the enemy's aboard Arsenal . But I suggest you be careful . Make sure Emma gets here in one piece . 
 Yeah . What's up ? 
 Can Emma walk ? 
 Right . . . the oil fence -- 
 Raiden, you're carrying a PSG1, aren't you ? It's time to play sniper . 
 You're going to have to cover Emma until she crosses to Strut E . I'll get there and provide some support of my own . 
 Think you can handle it ? 
 VR . . . ? Guess that's better than nothing . Make sure you don't hit Emma . 
 That doesn't mean it's going to be easy . Given the situation, they've probably got Claymores in place to make up for the security shortage . Make sure you use your thermal goggles . 
 This is Snake . Can you hear me ? 
 I've reached my sniping position on Strut E . I'll provide support fire from here . 
 Just call me when you want me to shoot . 
 Raiden ! Emma's been stabbed ! 
 She's conscious . . . but the bleeding's bad . I'm bringing her over there right now ! 
 Raiden ! Get that disc over here as soon as possible . I'm afraid her time's running out . . . 
 Emma seems to be uh . . . doing something to GW's defensive capabilities . All we need now is your disc . You'd better hurry -- I don't think she's gonna make it . 
 She's . . . Just get over here . You'll find the coast is clear with everybody aboard Arsenal right now . 
 I think he got some internal organs . . . We can't stop the bleeding . . . 
 Got the disc ? 
 Emma set everything up . Apparently all you have to do is pop in the disc . 
 Um . . . that should insert the virus into the AI . . . 
 Just leave it to Emma . 
 What the --  ! ? 
 Damn ! The connections been cut ! 
 I don't think so . The counts stopped at 90% . Otacon . . . ? 
 Will the virus still work ? 
 Either destroy that thing, or take out Solidus and his men . 
 I don't think we can, unless somebody inside gives us a hand . 
 Sounds like they're cutting this place loose ! 
 We have to get the hostages out . 
 We'll just have to take as many as we can . 
 Otacon, take care of the hostages . 
 We've got other arrangements . . . 
 There's our ride out of here . Anyway, we're gonna have to sink that thing of the virus doesn't work . 
 You've got your job, we've got ours . 
 Wrong . 
 Only you can save those hostages . Got it ? 
 Listen, Otacon, pull yourself together . You've got a job to do . 
 I'm counting on you, Otacon . 
 He's tougher than he looks, consider it done . 
 You can come out now . 
 Bedtime, Raiden . 
 I wouldn't do that . 
 Change sides ? I don't recall saying I was on yours . 
 It's amazing you can walk around like that . 
 Been waiting long ? 
 Right over there . 
 That's more like it . Everything you had when you were captured is still there . 
 Sorry about earlier . I had to use you as bait to gain access to Arsenal . It worked . 
 You never asked . 
 Not happy about that ? Get over it . 
 Still waiting on that . 
 Looks like it . From what I can tell, Arsenal is headed for Manhattan . I don't know what Solidus is planning, but we'll have to deal with it one way or another . There's also a troop of production-model Rays ahead . 
 Twenty-five, according to Olga . 
 Yeah . Can't say I've faced that many Metal Gears before, but -- I think we can deal . 
 We can because we have no other choice . I've stocked up on Stinger missiles . Oh yeah, Olga left this for you . 
 Olga asked me to give it to you . Besides, I'm not a big fan of blades . 
 Come on, time to go . 
 If you run out of ammo, you can have mine . 
 Absolutely . 
 Infinite ammo . 
 What ? 
 Diminished sense of reality, huh ? VR training will do that . 
 Raiden, we don't carry guns to take people down . We're not here to help some politician either . 
 Legends don't mean a whole lot . I was just a name to exploit . Just like you . People will remember only the good part, the right part of what you did . 
 And we're not in this to make a name for ourselves . 
 A future . 
 You can stop being part of a mistake, starting now . 
 Find something to believe in . And find it for yourself . And when you do, pass it on to the future . 
 That's your problem . 
 Come on ! 
 Otacon ! You all right ? 
 Raiden ! 
 I don't know . What I do know is that you're standing right here in front of me . Not an illusion -- flesh and blood . It's your call . You can drop this if you want . 
 It's a trap ! 
 Raiden, get a grip ! 
 It's a trap . Since the Colonel doesn't exist, there's no way he can take Rose hostage . 
 I am right . 
 Don't be weird . She's your -- 
 Don't jump to conclusions ! 
 What ? 
 Looks like I'm today's pick . You go on ahead . 
 You want eternal rest ? I've got it right here . 
 I'll think of something . There's no such thing as a witch . 
 I don't know what your group's been through, but let's get one thing clear . . . I didn't kill your father . 
 Raiden, get out of here ! 
 UNHh ! ! 
  ! ? 
 Damn ! 
 Everybody down ! 
 She is Lady Luck . 
 No ! 
 Liquid ! 
 You were inside Ocelot ? 
 It was you two years ago ! ? 
 Damn ! 
 Liquid ! Stop this thing ! 
 Hrrraa ! ! ! 
 No one quite knows who or what they are . 
 The memories you have and the role you were assigned are burdens you have to carry . It doesn't matter if they were real or not . That's never the point . 
 There's no such thing in the world as absolute reality . Most of what they call real is actually fiction . What you think you see is only as real as your brain tells you it is . 
 We can tell other people about -- having faith . What we had faith in . What we found important enough to fight for . It's not whether you were right or wrong, but how much faith you were willing to have, that decides the future . The Patriots are a kind of ongoing fiction too, come to think of it . . . . 
 Listen, don't obsess over words so much . Find the meaning behind the words, then decide . You can find your own name . And your own future . . . 
 And whatever you choose will be you . 
 I know you didn't have much in terms of choices this time . But everything you felt, thought about during this mission is yours . And what you decide to do with them is your choice . . . 
 Yeah, a clean slate . A new name, new memories . Choose your own legacy . It's for you to decide . It's up to you . 
 By the way, what is that ? 
 Anyone you know ? 
 I know . We've inherited freedom from all those who've fought for it . We all have the freedom to spread the word . Even me . 
 Don't worry, I'll find him . Count on it . As long as you keep yourself alive, he's safe . 
 I put a transmitter on his RAY . 
 Yeah . But I have a feeling they gave Ocelot a bogus location to begin with . 
 Cheer up . We have a better lead . 
 This contains a list of all the Patriots . 
 The one we gave you wasn't the real thing . 
 This virus is coded to destroy only a specific part of GW -- namely the information about the Patriots identity . Which means, that there is a parameter coded in here that defines what that information is . 
 No, you have things to do first . And people you need to talk to . . . 
 Life isn't just about passing on your genes . We can leave behind much more than just DNA . Through speech, music, literature and movies . . . what we've seen, heard, felt  . . .anger, joy and sorrow . . . these are the things I will pass on .  That's what I live for .  We need to pass the torch, and let our children read our messy and sad history by its light . We have all the magic of the digital age to do that with . The human race will probably come to an end some time, and new species may rule over this planet . Earth may not be forever, but we still have the responsibility to leave what traces of life we can . Building the future and keeping the past alive are one and the same thing . 
 Did you find the Patriots' list ? 
 What's going on around here ? 
 Anyway, where are they ? 
 But what ? 
 When did it happen ? 
 What the hell ? 
 So's war, and I've done that all my life . 
 This is the new kind that has almost no second-hand smoke . It won't bother anyone . 
 Ummm . . . 
 Otacon, I took the Pentazemin and you're right -- the seasickness is gone ! 
  . . . 
 What is this, all of a sudden ? 
 Almost reminds me of Mei Ling, but . . . You sure you got it right ? 
 Great . . .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
  . . .okay . If you say so . 
 What do jeans have to do with nature and order ? 
 Earnings . . . ?  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 Did they even have daylight savings back then ? 
 But you said -- 
 Okay . . . ?  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 Look -- this stuff seems nothing like what Mei Ling used to talk about . 
 Sure . All right . 
 Did you say something ? 
 Is that really all it means ? 
 Hold on . I thought the idea of Original Sin was that you had to work even harder at being good because you were born evil ! 
 Wasn't Paris a person ? Paris . I thought he was a -- 
 Huh ? Ah, sorry . . . ?  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 This seems to be getting more and more random . 
  . . .I really think you've got this one wrong .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 Look, what I heard from Mei Ling was that -- 
 Huh ? That isn't the -- 
 Why would aliens be in an old Chinese proverb ? 
  . . .news to me .  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 What's going on over there ? 
 What happened to Mei Ling ? 
 What did you do ? 
 I see you're wearing body armor . That's a great way to minimize damage . Your body armor is interwoven with a special fiber made from high-performance polymer materials . The special fiber tangles around a bullet to cushion and spread out the impact to keep damage at a minimum . Bear in mind that the armor just reduces damage . It doesn't eliminate it . 
 All right already . . . That's enough !  - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 
 Otacon's busy right now . You'll have to settle for me . 
 Right . Now what do you want ? 
 Then what is it for ? 
 That sounds pretty greedy . 
 And what's your dream ? 
 Revenge ? 
 Of all the idiotic . . . I think that's enough . 
 I'll pretend this conversation never happened . . . 
 Emma ! 
 You're speaking your mind . . . not your heart . Just leave it at that .
